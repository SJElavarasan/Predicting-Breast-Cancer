# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of breast cancer in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing clinical and diagnostic features, the goal is to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment planning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains clinical and diagnostic features extracted from breast cancer patients, including characteristics of cell nuclei from fine needle aspirates of breast mass. It may include data collected from various medical institutions or research studies.

## Machine Learning Approach
The breast cancer prediction model is built using supervised learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's predictive performance.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, or prediction.
- `models/`: Saved trained machine learning models.
- `results/`: Generated visualizations, performance metrics, and summary reports.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd breast-cancer-prediction
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data analysis and model building process.

4. Run the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory for specific tasks, such as data preprocessing or model training.

5. Use the trained machine learning model for making predictions on new data or integrating it into a larger healthcare system.
